# Step 2 Complete: Backend API Enhancements

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the backend API to support the new PDF upload workflow with temporary processing and user-controlled storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced PDF Management Controller
File: `backend/controller/pdf/pdfManagement.js`

#### New Endpoints Added:
- **`processPDFTemporary`**: Processes uploaded PDF without storing in database
  - Route: `POST /api/pdf/process-temporary`
  - Functionality: Upload → Process → Return results without permanent storage
  - Response includes processing status and extracted data

- **`storePDFInDatabase`**: Stores previously processed PDF in database
  - Route: `POST /api/pdf/store/:pdfId`
  - Functionality: Takes processed PDF data and permanently stores it
  - Updates `isStored` flag and storage metadata

- **`getStoredPDFs`**: Retrieves user's stored PDFs
  - Route: `GET /api/pdf/stored`
  - Functionality: Returns list of permanently stored PDFs only
  - Supports filtering and pagination

- **`getPDFProcessingStatus`**: Gets real-time processing status
  - Route: `GET /api/pdf/status/:pdfId`
  - Functionality: Returns current processing status and progress
  - Useful for status polling during processing

### 2. Updated Routes
File: `backend/routes/pdf.route.js`

#### New Routes Added:
```javascript
// Enhanced workflow routes
router.post("/process-temporary", verifyToken, memoryUpload.single('pdf'), processPDFTemporary);
router.post("/store/:pdfId", verifyToken, storePDFInDatabase);
router.get("/stored", verifyToken, getStoredPDFs);
router.get("/status/:pdfId", verifyToken, getPDFProcessingStatus);
```

#### Import Updates:
- Added imports for all new controller functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing routes

## API Workflow
The enhanced API now supports this workflow:

1. **Upload & Process Temporarily**: `POST /api/pdf/process-temporary`
   - User uploads PDF
   - System processes it immediately
   - Returns results without permanent storage
   - User gets prompt: "Store in Database?"

2. **Store Decision**: `POST /api/pdf/store/:pdfId`
   - If user chooses "Yes": PDF stored permanently
   - If user chooses "No": Temporary data discarded

3. **View Stored PDFs**: `GET /api/pdf/stored`
   - Shows only permanently stored PDFs
   - Displays processing status and results

4. **Status Monitoring**: `GET /api/pdf/status/:pdfId`
   - Real-time processing status updates
   - Progress indicators for long operations

## Next Steps
- **Step 3**: Update frontend components to use new API endpoints
  - Modify PDF upload component for new workflow
  - Add storage decision dialog
  - Update PDF list to show stored items only
  - Add processing status indicators

## Files Modified
- ✅ `backend/controller/pdf/pdfManagement.js` (new endpoints added)
- ✅ `backend/routes/pdf.route.js` (new routes exposed)
- ✅ `backend/models/pdf.model.js` (already updated in Step 1)

## Testing
Once frontend is updated, test:
1. Upload PDF → Process → Choose not to store
2. Upload PDF → Process → Choose to store → Verify in stored list
3. View processing status during long operations
4. Verify stored PDFs display properly
