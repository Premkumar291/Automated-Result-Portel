# Test Push - API Key Security Fix

This file is created to test if the API key security issue has been resolved after cleaning the git history.

The following changes were made:
- Removed hardcoded API keys from all files
- Cleaned git history using filter-branch
- Added .env.example for reference
- Uses environment variables for all sensitive data

If this push succeeds, the API key security issue has been resolved.
